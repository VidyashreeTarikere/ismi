    <h3 class="title">Entrepreneurship and Susi Air</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="quote">In 1983, Pudjiastuti embarked on a career as an entrepreneur, starting as a seafood distributor at a Fish Auction Facility (TPI) in Pangandaran.[11] Her distributorship evolved into a seafood processing plant in 1996 named PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product, which specialised in export-quality lobsters packaged as 'Susi Brand'.PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product expanded, and began exporting its products to Asia and America
    </p>

    <p class="quote">The growing demand for PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product's fresh seafood lead to rapid air transport as a necessity for the business. In 2004, Pudjiastuti acquired a Cessna 208 Caravan, and established PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation. The Cessna was given the call-sign 'Susi Air', and was used to transport fresh Indonesian seafood to Jakarta, as well as overseas to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan.[14]

      During the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which devastated Aceh and the west coast of Sumatra, Susi Air, which at the time only consisted of two Cessna Grand Caravans, was one of the first responders which distributed food and supplies to victims in isolated areas of the disaster. During this period, Susi Air was routinely chartered in Aceh by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for humanitarian relief missions. The revenues earned from the NGO Aceh missions enabled Susi Air to acquire new aeroplanes,
       and expand its fleet to routes in Papua and Kalimantan. Susi Air is now the largest operator of Cessna Grand Caravans in the Asia Pacific region[15]
